  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><b>Last updated:</b> 2026-02-03</p>

  <p>Pinly is designed to work without creating an account. By default, your pins and reminders are stored on your device. If you enable iCloud, your data may be stored in your iCloud account to support backup/restore or syncing (depending on the features you use).</p>

  <h2>Information Pinly uses</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Location (optional):</b> Used on-device to monitor geofences and notify you when you arrive near pinned places. Pinly requests “Always” location only if you enable location reminders.</li>
    <li><b>Notifications (optional):</b> Used to deliver local alerts for timed and location reminders.</li>
    <li><b>iCloud (optional):</b> If enabled, data may be saved to iCloud for backup/restore.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information we collect</h2>
  <p>Pinly does not operate a developer server for storing your personal data. We do not sell your data.</p>

  <h2>Analytics and tracking</h2>
  <p>Pinly does not include third-party advertising SDKs. If we add analytics or crash reporting in the future, this policy will be updated.</p>

  <h2>Data retention</h2>
  <p>Your data remains on your device unless you delete it. If you use iCloud, Apple’s iCloud services may retain data according to your iCloud settings.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, contact us via the <a href="support.html">Support</a> page.</p>
